* App
** lines: An arraylist representing segments of the road
** N: The number of "segments" in lines
** pos: position of the player
** player_x: position of the player on the x-axis (sideways)
** cam_height: always X amount above the segment height
** x (render_road): horizontal position of the current segment
** dx: change in horizontal offset



* Code notes
** Line cur_line = lines.get(n % N);
*** Use n % N to ensure array stays within bounds

** cur_line.project(player_x - x, cam_height, pos);
*** projects current line, uses player_x - x to account for curavture

** double adjusted_bg_offset = bg_offset % background.getWidth();
*** similar idea, use modulus to "wrap around"

** int seg_index = pos / SEG_LENGTH;
*** get the current position, accounts for the segment length


* Implementation
** Movement
*** Start at no accel, speeds up gradually
*** Turning doesn't move player as much at a lower speed
*** Going on the rumble/grass slowly stops car
*** Grass will slow car faster than rumble will
*** pos += velocity
*** velocity recalculated every move
*** velocity
*** The player actually "moves" by changing the background and not the car
